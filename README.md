# Platform Architecture & Engineering Notes

This repository is intentionally focused on **architecture, design decisions, and engineering practices**, rather than full production code.

Most of my professional work involves **proprietary systems, security-sensitive platforms, and enterprise environments**, where source code cannot be publicly shared.  
This space exists to demonstrate **how I think, design, and reason about systems**.

---

## Areas of Experience

- Backend and API architecture (Python, RESTful services)
- System integration and automation
- Infrastructure-aware application design
- Security-oriented backend components
- Platform reliability, observability, and scalability
- Full-stack collaboration with frontend teams

---

## Example: Custom Firewall (VBScript)

One example of a real-world system I designed and implemented is a **custom application-level firewall**, focused on request filtering, rule-based blocking, and operational safety.

Due to its nature, the full source code is not published here, but the **technical design, behavior, and rationale** are documented in detail:

This project demonstrates:
- Security-first thinking
- Defensive programming
- Low-level request inspection
- Production-oriented decision making

---

## How I Work

- I prioritize **clear contracts, maintainability, and observability**
- I avoid unnecessary complexity and favor incremental evolution
- I design systems to be understandable by other engineers
- I document decisions and trade-offs explicitly

---

## Interview Note

I’m happy to:
- Walk through architectures I’ve designed
- Explain trade-offs and decisions
- Discuss real production challenges
- Review pseudocode or sanitized examples during interviews
